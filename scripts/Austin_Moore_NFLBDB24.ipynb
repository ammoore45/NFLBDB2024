    "# To Breakdown or not to Breakdown : An Open Field Tackle Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Tackling in American football is a fundamental aspect of the game, serving as a decisive defensive skill that can shape the course of a play or even an entire game. These dynamic events encompass countless scenarios that elicit a unique response from the defender. Arguably the most difficult of these scenarios occurs in the open field. Without the leverage of teammates or the sideline, proper technique is critical to ensure execution at the point of attack. One such technique is what this paper will refer to as “breaking down” for the tackle. This involves slowing down and adopting a balanced stance. This makes it easier for the defender to react to the movements of the ball carrier. The assumed tradeoff of a break down is an increase in the likelihood of completing a successful tackle for time and distance gained by the ball carrier. The purpose of this report is to isolate open field scenarios and test if breaking down for a tackle is associated with the execution of such."

    "All data used in this analysis was supplied as part of the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl.

    "<li> No other players within the tackling lane. This is verified by checking that all players not involved in the open field tackle are outside the $(x_{min}-1,y_{min}-1)$x$(x_{max}+1,y_{max}+1)$ box built off of the tackler and ball carriers positions. The aim is to verify that there is ample space to consider the event as having occurred in the open field. </li>\n",

    "As previously stated, the intention of this report is to understand if there is an association between the ball carrier breaking down for a tackle and the execution of assignment. The method chosen to prove such is the Chi-Square Test of Association. The variables to be tested are the tSlowed variable indicating that a player has significantly decelerated within the final 5 yards and the resulting tackle indication. For the purposes of this report, we will assume that tSlowed is indicative of the defender breaking down. Before proceeding with this test ample quantities of samples will need to be validated. This can be done by validating that all expected frequencies have a value of 5."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "Between the deceleration of the defender not being significantly associated with the tackle outcome and maintaining acceleration being associated with the tackle outcome, results seem promising for defensive minds that believe taking away time and space is key to securing an open field tackle. Due to limited sample size and unmeasured factors, further investigation will be needed to better express these initial results. The break down is one of many actions prescribed in most open field tackle procedures. Others factors include but are not limited to helmet placement (cross body v Rugby style), lowering the center of mass, wrapping up the ball carrier, driving through the point of contact, maintaining horizontal leverage, etc. Some of these are measurable with the provided data set and some are not. Regardless, additional data and feature development would allow for more precise and significant results via more advanced analytical methods.\n"
